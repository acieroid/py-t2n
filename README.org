py-t2n -- Talk To NXT with Python

py-t2n is an utility to get informations, send files or receives files
from a NXT Lego Brick, through USB or Bluetooth.

The usage is the same as the one of [[http://www-verimag.imag.fr/~raymond/edu/lego/t2n/][t2n]], and the output is mostly the
same. The aim of py-t2n is to have a simple tool like t2n, but which
is alive and compatible with last NXT firmwares (t2n doesn't work with
firmwares versions > 1.05). This goal is achieved easily thanks to the
[[http://code.google.com/p/nxt-python/][nxt-python]] library (some of the code is actually taken from
nxt-python's scripts). py-t2n is GPLv3 licensed.

* Installation
Installation is easy:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone git://github.com/acieroid/py-t2n
cd py-t2n
python setup.py install
#+END_SRC

py-t2n has been tested successfully on FreeBSD and Linux, and should
work on Microsoft Windows and any other OS where nxt-python is
running.

* Usage
